Ecosystem Modelling Group

1. Overview
Marine organisms are connected by diverse types of interactions. Understanding the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships through the modelling of ecological interactions is far from trivial. This is because most interactions vary during seasons and the exposure of ecosystems to multi-stressors (e.g. ocean warming, species invasion, overfishing and eutrophication) makes complicated the identification of cause-effect mechanisms.

2. Our goals
Research in the group aims at (1) investigating the relationships between physical forcing and ecosystem functioning under the effect of global warming, and (2) quantifying the impact of multi-stressors on ocean ecosystem.
