<p>Ecosystem Modelling Group</p>

<p>1. Overview</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a Marine organisms are connected by diverse types of interactions. Understanding the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships through the modelling of ecological interactions is far from trivial. This is because most interactions vary during seasons and the exposure of ecosystems to multi-stressors (e.g. ocean warming, species invasion, overfishing and eutrophication) makes complicated the identification of cause-effect mechanisms.></a> </li>  
</ul>


<p>2. Our goals</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a Research in the group aims at (1) investigating the relationships between physical forcing and ecosystem functioning under the effect of global warming, and (2) quantifying the impact of multi-stressors on ocean ecosystem.></a> </li>
